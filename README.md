# XMPP.is

This repository contains scripts and configs used for the XMPP.is server. I try to make it as transparent as possible, while hiding some secrets that run in the cron. Such as the script that injects usernames for admin accounts after a config update.

For more information about the server, check out our site: https://xmpp.is/
