It appears something is up with something along the route from US to Hetzner at
least. Looks like I'm getting huge packet loss from US -> Hetzner. I've tested
Netherlands -> Hetzner and it's fine. Any network issues going on currently?

Dear Client,

unfortunately there is an issue at one of our upstream providers ( http://status.core-backbone.com/index.php?id=1863 ) on the connection between USA and Europe. At the moment we are not sure if this is the reason for the packet loss on your connection. 

The server itself is reachable on our side and there is no issue within our infrastructure given.

If the problem is still existing please use a program such as MTR to send us traces over 1000 packets in both directions (client -> server; server -> client) for the problematic connection during the time in which the issue occurs.

Our network department requests both traces (client -> server and server -> client) to make a qualified analysis of your problematic case.

MTR is a diagnostic tool which can be used to determine which routers transmit data packets onto the destination host and which routers may be experiencing problems.

For Windows, "WinMTR" can be downloaded free of charge (via
http://sourceforge.net/projects/winmtr .

For Linux, MTR can be installed using the appropriate package manager for your
distribution.

Please see below for more information regarding the instructions for an error report concerning network problems:

Thank you for your understanding.


Mit freundlichen Grüßen / Kind regards
